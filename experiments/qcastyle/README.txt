This C++ program is a Fiction experiment that evaluates all SQD files in
FICTION_EXPERIMENTS_FOLDER/qcastyle/gates (it is not recursive).

It identifies logic gates by filename prefix and outputs 6 CSV files per input.

NOTE: Some wires may need to be treated as inverters, and vice-versa,
for proper simulation.
